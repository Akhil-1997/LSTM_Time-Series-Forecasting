# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Project Description

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The forecasting is done on the Jena Climate dataset, focusing on temperature predictions. Two approaches are explored:

1. **Univariate Forecasting**: Predicting future temperature values using past temperature data.
2. **Multivariate Forecasting**: Predicting future temperature values using multiple features such as temperature, potential temperature, vapor pressure, and dew point temperature.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Jena Climate dataset, which contains various atmospheric measurements collected over several years. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip).
